Customers can view the products, add them to their cart, change the amount, and pay cash on delivery. Admin can apply discounts to any product and create vouchers for a particular period of time. This project’s front end is built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. In addition, the project’s back end is written in PHP.
